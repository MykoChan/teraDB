teraDB
======

teraDB is a database containing information about items, classes, races, skills and other related in game content that I plan to make available for TERA players. I'd like to make this website be more than just a library of raw searchable game data, I'd like to extend this to make it easier for people to plan their next objective in the game or improve their gameplay experience by providing useful tools. 

Here are a few things I plan to add:

- Better searchable items (compared to other databases like TeraToday.com)
- gear progression/pve/pvp/crafting guides
- Theorycrafting tools (Damage calculations, skill rotations, team compositions etc)
- Glyph builds
- Farming spreadsheets

Since this is not yet available, here is a screenshot of a prototype I have so far.
